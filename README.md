# sash shell

## How to run?
Compile - `make main` <br/>
Run     -  `./a.out`

### Built in commands:
 -> cd<br/>
 -> ls<br/>
 -> pwd<br/>
 -> echo<br/>
 -> jobs<br/>
 -> pinfo<br/>
 -> overkill<br/>
 -> kjob<br/>


 Executes foreground and background processes and informs about the exit status of the command. Now added support for pipes and added many builtin commands to handle jobs
